<dl class="faq">
	<dt><a id="add" name="add"></a>How do I add a site to the ODP?</dt>

	<dd>Adding a site is easy! Simply follow these <a href="/docs/en/add.html">instructions</a>.</dd>

	<dt><a id="howlong" name="howlong"></a>How long does it take for my site to be listed in the ODP?</dt>

	<dd>Depending on the activity level of the editors in your area, it may take up to 2 weeks or more for your site to be reviewed. While the ODP is comprehensive in scope and coverage, we care a great deal about the quality of the ODP, and pride ourselves on being highly selective. We don't accept all sites, so please don't take it personally should your site not be accepted. Our goal is to make the directory as useful as possible for our users, not to have the directory include all (or even most) of the sites that could possibly be listed or serve as a promotional tool for the entities listed.</dd>

	<dt><a id="express" name="express"></a>Does the ODP have an express submit service that will get my site listed quicker?</dt>

	<dd>
		<p>The ODP does not have an express service similar to other commercial directories however, there are several things you can do to help expedite review of your submission. First, follow the submission guidelines carefully.</p>

		<p>Secondly, you may want to review some of our <a href="/docs/en/guidelines/describing.html">editorial policies</a> that the editors use to list sites. A well-written, thoughtful submission has a greater chance of getting reviewed sooner than a sloppy, careless one.</p>

		<p>We do not, however, recommend suggesting your site to many different categories in hopes that one or two will end up being listed. This will not get your site listed quicker, and may in fact significantly delay processing. This may be interpreted as spam, which could result in your site not getting listed at all.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt><a id="multiple" name="multiple"></a>How do I get my site listed in more than one category?</dt>

	<dd>You should suggest your site to the single most appropriate category that is directly relevant to your site's content. Please only suggest your site one time. The ODP editors reserve the right to use their editorial discretion to determine which category or categories your site will ultimately be placed.</dd>

	<dt><a id="downstream" name="downstream"></a>How long does it take for my site to show up in a search engine that uses ODP data, such as AOL Search or Netscape Search?</dt>

	<dd>Once your site is listed in the ODP, it may take up to 2 weeks or more for your site to appear on any of the search engines that use ODP data. It is the responsibility of those search engines to pick up the latest version of our data. The ODP has no control over when third parties update their ODP data.</dd>

	<dt><a id="addhelp" name="addhelp"></a>Who do I ask for help regarding my site and getting it listed in the proper category?</dt>

	<dd>If after searching the enormous array of subject categories, you are still unsure as to where you should suggest your site, your best bet would be to suggest your site to the category you think best reflects the content on your site.&nbsp; The editors have the ability to move your site to a different category, or create a new one, should there be a need.</dd>

	<dt><a id="noadd" name="noadd"></a>What should I do if the category where I want to submit my site does not have an Add URL link?</dt>

	<dd>A few categories have the Add URL link disabled, and don't list or accept suggestions. You would find a more specific category further down the tree.</dd>
